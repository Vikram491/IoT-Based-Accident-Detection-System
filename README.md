**🚗 IoT-Based Accident Detection System**


**📌 Project Overview**

The IoT-Based Accident Detection System is designed to automatically detect road accidents using sensor data and immediately trigger alerts. The system aims to reduce emergency response time by identifying accidents in real time and notifying concerned authorities or contacts, thereby potentially saving lives.

**🎯 Objectives**

Detect vehicle accidents automatically using sensor readings

Minimize delay in accident reporting

Improve road safety through real-time monitoring

Reduce dependency on manual accident reporting

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python

IoT Sensors (Simulated / Real-time data)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Processing & Analysis Libraries

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib
**
⚙️ System Workflow**

Sensor data (such as vibration, tilt, or acceleration) is collected.

The data is continuously monitored and analyzed.

If abnormal patterns exceed a predefined threshold, an accident is detected.

An alert mechanism is triggered for emergency response.
